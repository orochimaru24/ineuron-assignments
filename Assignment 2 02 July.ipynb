    "\n",
    "- itâ€™s a way to derive new classes from existing ones.\n",
    "- The class that inherits from another class is called a subclass or child class, while the class being inherited from is known as the parent class, superclass, or base class.\n",
    "- Inheritance enables you to build upon existing functionality without duplicating code.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Code Reusability: Inheritance allows you to share common attributes and methods among related classes. Instead of rewriting the same code for each class, you can create a base class with shared functionality and then extend it to create specialized subclasses.\n",
    "- Modularity: By organizing code into classes and using inheritance, you achieve a modular structure. Each class focuses on a specific aspect of your application, making it easier to manage and maintain.\n",
    "- Efficiency: When you need to make changes or enhancements, you can do so in the base class. All derived classes automatically inherit these modifications, reducing the effort required to update multiple places in your code.\n",
    "- Polymorphism: Inheritance is closely tied to polymorphism, another OOP concept. Polymorphism allows you to treat objects of different classes uniformly, as long as they share a common base class. This flexibility simplifies code design and promotes extensibility.\n"

    "\n",
    "- Single inheritance occurs when a subclass inherits from a single superclass. In other words, the derived class has only one direct parent class. \n",
    "\n",
    "- Multiple inheritance occurs when a child class inherits from more than one base class. Although Python allows multiple inheritance, it should be used judiciously due to the following reasons:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Complexity: Managing multiple parent classes can become intricate.\n",
    "2. Safety: Single inheritance is simpler, safer, and easier to understand and maintain.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Single Inheritance:\n",
    "1. Subclass inherits from a single superclass.\n",
    "2. Simpler and straightforward.\n",
    "3. Easier to manage.\n",
    "4. Example: A Car class inheriting from a Vehicle class.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Multiple Inheritance:\n",
    "1. Subclass inherits from multiple superclasses.\n",
    "2. Powerful but requires careful design.\n",

    "- Base Class (Superclass):\n",
    "1. A base class (also known as a superclass or parent class) is the class from which other classes inherit properties (attributes) and behaviors (methods).\n",
    "2. It serves as the foundation for creating new classes.\n",
    "3. Base classes define common attributes and methods that can be shared by multiple subclasses.\n",
    "4. Example: Consider a Vehicle class with attributes like color, fuel_type, and methods like start_engine() and stop_engine(). The Car and Motorcycle classes can inherit from this base class.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Derived Class (Subclass):\n",
    "1. A derived class (also known as a subclass or child class) is a class that inherits properties and behaviors from a base class.\n",
    "2. It extends or specializes the functionality of the base class by adding new attributes or overriding existing methods.\n",
    "3. Derived classes can have additional attributes and methods specific to their own context.\n",
    "4. Example: If we create a Car class that inherits from the Vehicle base class, it can add specific attributes like num_doors and methods like accelerate()."

    "\n",

    "2. By default, all data members and member functions of a class are public.\n",

    "- By using super(), you can extend and customize the functionality inherited from the parent class while still benefiting from it. "
